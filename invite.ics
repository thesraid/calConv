SUMMARY:Therapy?
LOCATION:Cyprus Avenue
URL:https://www.facebook.com/events/460206744507522/
DESCRIPTION:Andy Cairns tells a great story ab
 out Therapy?’s spring UK tour wi
 th The Stranglers. As the trio wal
 ked onstage in Kilmarnock\, Scotlan
 d\, their frontman noticed a solita
 ry punter\, three rows from the fro
 nt\, vigorously booing his band bef
 ore a single amplified guitar chor
 d had been struck. Each successive
  song in the set received the same
  vociferous\, relentlessly hostile 
 response. Two nights later\, at Not
 tingham Rock City\, the antagonist 
 was back once more\, front and cent
 re\, still booing\, though with mark
 edly less enmity than before. In M
 anchester\, on the final night of t
 he campaign\, Cairns stepped from h
 is tour bus to be confronted again
  by the by-now-familiar face of hi
 s new nemesis. This time\, however\,
  the guy was clutching a pen and a
  copy of Therapy?’s classic 1994
  album Troublegum. “Could you si
 gn this for me please?” he asked
  politely.\n\n“I think we’d ba
 ttered him into submission\,” Cai
 rns says with a laugh.\n\nIt’s a
 n instructive anecdote\, both a tes
 tament to Therapy?’s enduring ca
 pacity to win over hearts and mind
 s with their singular\, sui generis
  sound\, and a reminder\, in a broad
 er sense\, that even in the face of
  alienation\, disaffection and disc
 ord\, there remains hope for consen
 sus\, harmony and solidarity. \n\nW
 hich brings us\, neatly\, to Therapy
 ?’s fifteenth studio album\, Clea
 ve. Roughly themed around notions 
 of duality and division\, the band’
 s follow-up to 2015’s acclaimed 
 Disquiet - and their first recordi
 ng for new label Marshall Records 
 – is a sharply focused\, fiercely
  intelligent\, impassioned and empo
 wering set of songs from a band op
 erating at a creative and artistic
  peak. A scathing\, incisive state-
 of-the-nation address\, investigati
 ng the schisms in contemporary soc
 iety and the motivations of those 
 seeking to propagate disjuncture\, 
 it’s a powerful\, challenging\, un
 compromising collection from a ban
 d never afraid to confront and dis
 sect humanity’s darkest impulses

 this for me please?” he asked po
 litely.\n“I think we’d battered
  him into submission\,” Cairns sa
 ys with a laugh.\nIt’s an instruc
 tive anecdote\, both a testament to
  Therapy?’s enduring capacity to
  win over hearts and minds with th
 eir singular\, sui generis sound\, a
 nd a reminder\, in a broader sense\,
  that even in the face of alienati

 e remains hope for consensus\, harm
 ony and solidarity. \nWhich brings 
 us\, neatly\, to Therapy?’s fiftee
 nth studio album\, Cleave. Roughly 
 themed around notions of duality a
 nd division\, the band’s follow-u
 p to 2015’s acclaimed Disquiet -
  and their first recording for new
  label Marshall Records – is a s
 harply focused\, fiercely intellige

  a creative and artistic peak. A s
 cathing\, incisive state-of-the-nat

 he motivations of those seeking to
  propagate disjuncture\, it’s a p
 owerful\, challenging\, uncompromisi

 ity’s darkest impulses.\n\nFrom th
 e thrillingly propulsive assault o
 f Wreck It Like Beckett via the ad
 dictive Callow (the album's first 
 single\, out now) and the unsettlin
 g I Stand Alone to the disquieting
 \, bleakly beautiful No Sunshine\, t
 he ten tracks which make up Cleave
  coalesce to paint a portrait of a
  fractured\, dislocated world rent 
 by unprincipled\, mendacious master
 s.\n“We’re living in a time riv
 en by conflict\,” Andy Cairns sta
 tes baldly. “You look at what’
 s happening in the United States a
 t present\, what’s going on with 
 Brexit in the UK\, with North and S
 outh Korea\, with Palestine and Isr
 ael\, and it’s impossible not to 
 see turmoil and turbulence. Some o
 f these conflicts have been going 
 on as long as I can remember\, but 
 they seemed to really reach a head
  again around the time we were wri
 ting the album. Cleave is our resp
 onse to the divisions we see all a
 round us.”\n\nIt’s worth conside
 ring Therapy?’s journey to this 
 point. Their story begins in North
 ern Ireland in 1989\, when vocalist
 /guitarist Cairns\, bassist Michael
  McKeegan and drummer Fyfe Ewing –
  bonded by a deep appreciation of 
 post-punk\, art-rock\, Detroit techn
 o and the most uncompromising soun
 ds from the fringes of the US nois
 e rock underground – embarked up
 on a mission to investigate the ps
 yches of the marginalised\, malcont
 ent and misanthropic. The 1990 rel
 ease of a self-financed seven inch
  single (Meat Abstract) on the ban
 d’s own Multifuckingnational Rec
 ords label\, was followed by the re
 cording of a brace of bold\, abrasi
 ve mini albums\, 1991's Babyteeth a
 nd 1992's Pleasure Death\, for Lond
 on-based Wiiija record\, both colle
 ctions securing Number 1 slots on 
 the UK’s Independent music chart
 s. Such success did not go unnotic
 ed by the nation’s major labels\,
  and the in-demand trio elected to
  partner next with A&M Records\, fo
 r whom they promptly delivered a T
 op 30 single (Teethgrinder) and To
 p 40 album (Nurse) in 1993. On a c
 reative roll\, in 1994 Therapy? tru
 ly hit their stride with the elect
 rifying\, exhilarating punk-metal c
 rossover set Troublegum\, which ser
 ved up no fewer than five UK Top 4
 0 singles (Turn\, Nowhere\, Die Laug
 hing\, Trigger Inside and Screamage
 r\, the opening track from 1993 EP 
 Shortsharpshock)\, sold one million
  copies worldwide and garnered the
  fast-rising band a Mercury Music 
 Prize nomination. Unwilling to dil
 ute their vision in pursuit of mai
 nstream acceptance\, the band spent
  much of the two decades which fol
 lowed re-writing the rule book for
  what constitutes success for a mo
 dern rock act\, issuing a successio
 n of fiercely idiosyncratic albums
 \, aided and abetted by the recruit
 ment\, in 2002\, of drummer Neil Coo
 per. To the delight of their loyal
  fan-base\, in 2015 the trio concei
 ved a sequel of sorts to Troublegu
 m in Disquiet\, a brilliantly-reali
 sed\, bruisingly melodic punk/metal
  collection which took as its star
 ting point questions of where the 
 adolescent protagonist of their 19
 94 masterpiece might find himself 
 20 years on. Stepping away from th
 at fascinating narrative\, Cleave c
 ontinues along a similar sonic pat
 h\, alluding to the band’s ‘cla
 ssic’ sound while opening up new
  paths to explore.\n\n“The way I’
 ve described Cleave to people who’
 ve been asking is that it’s kind
 a like Nurse and Pleasure Death-er
 a Therapy? meets Troublegum\, but w
 ith a totally modern 21st century 
 production\,” says Cairns of the 
 10 song collection committed to ta
 pe by producer Chris Sheldon at Bl
 ast studios in Newcastle-upon-Tyne
  in January this year. “I think 
 we’ve become a lot more comforta
 ble about doing what we do best. A
 round the time of [2009’s] Crook
 ed Timber and [2010’s] A Brief C
 rack Of Light I was still trying t
 o prove a point to people that I l
 isten to a lot of different music 
 and trying to illustrate that in t
 he music we were writing. But when
  we did Disquiet and saw the react
 ion we got from people who love gu
 itar music and love our band it ma
 de me realise that there’s certa
 in things we do so well\, certain t
 hings that are so characteristic o
 f Therapy?\, so we decided to focus
  on these things. We never want to
  be a template band\, writing the s
 ame song forever\, but we did defin
 itely try to play to our strengths
 .” \nCairns credits producer Shel
 don\, who worked with the band on T
 roublegum\, 1998’s Semi-Detached 
 and 2003’s High Anxiety\, for kee
 ping the band fixated upon deliver
 ing their new material with maximu
 m impact\, streamlining arrangement
 s and stripping away extraneous fa
 t\, setting aside ego in service of
  the songs.\n“We know we can trus
 t Chris\,” says Cairns simply. “
 He has a great history with the ba
 nd and no agenda. It’s not like 
 he’s looking to make hit singles
 \, but he also wants the band to be
  at their maximum ability\, and he’
 s very good at pointing out proble
 ms without offending you! In pre-p
 roduction we shortened a lot of th
 e songs and got directly to the po
 int. You can get into your own lit
 tle bubble when you’re writing s
 ongs so it’s great to have someo
 ne objective come in and challenge
  you to re-think things.”\nThe re
 sult is one of the most formidable
 \, provocative and impactful albums
  of Therapy?’s storied 29 year c
 areer\, once again proving that the
  band’s pre-eminence as one of t
 he UK’s most inventive\, fearless
  and individualistic musical artis
 ts. Andy Cairns offers a detailed 
 dissection of the album in the tra
 ck-by-track breakdown that follows
 \, but taking a broader view of his
  band’s fifteenth studio set\, he
 ’s justifiably proud of the unif
 ied drive and restless creativity 
 evident in this powerful\, questing
  collection.\n“I know that we can
  be a difficult sell\, because we h
 ave no particular niche and no des
 ire to conform\,” he admits\, “b
 ut Therapy? have always the kind o
 f band that when people discover u
 s\, they immerse themselves deep an
 d keep us close to their hearts. W
 e’ve never been part of a trend\,
  so we’ve never been cast aside 
 when fashions changed. Cleave\, to 
 me\, is Therapy? at our most focuse
 d. I love our more experimental si
 de\, but I also love that this reco
 rd sounds like it was made by a ba
 nd who’re all reading from the s
 ame script and moving forward with
  the same determination and hunger

 2\nOn sale Thursday at 9am\n\nAndy  C
 airns  tells  a  great  story  abo
 ut  Therapy?͛s  spring  UK  tour 
  with  The  Stranglers.  As  the  
 trio  walked  onstage  in  Kilmarn
 ock\,  Scotland\,  their  frontman  
 noticed  a  solitary  punter\,  thr
 ee  rows  from  the  front\,  vigor
 ously  booing  his  band  before  
 a  single  amplified  guitar  chor
 d  had  been  struck.  Each  succe
 ssive  song  in  the  set  receive
 d  the  same  vociferous\,  relentl
 essly  hostile  response.  Two  ni
 ghts  later\,  at  Nottingham  Rock
   City\,  the  antagonist  was  bac
 k  once  more\,  front  and  centre
 \,  still  booing\,  though  with  m
 arkedly  less  enmity  than  befor
 e.  In  Manchester\,  on  the  fina
 l  night  of  the  campaign\,  Cair
 ns  stepped  from  his  tour  bus 
  to  be  confronted  again  by  th
 e  by-now-familiar  face  of  his 
  new  nemesis.  This  time\,  howev
 er\,  the  guy  was  clutching  a  
 pen  and  a  copy  of  Therapy?͛s
   classic  1994  album  Troublegum
 .  ͞Could  you  sign  this  for  
 me  please?͟  he  asked  politely
 .  ͞I  think  we͛d  battered  hi
 m  into  submission\,͟  Cairns  sa
 ys  with  a  laugh.  It͛s  an  in
 structive  anecdote\,  both  a  tes
 tament  to  Therapy?͛s  enduring 
  capacity  to  win  over  hearts  
 and  minds  with  their  singular\,
   sui  generis  sound\,  and  a  re
 minder\,  in  a  broader  sense\,  t
 hat  even  in  the  face  of  alie
 nation\,  disaffection  and  discor
 d\,  there  remains  hope  for  con
 sensus\,  harmony  and  solidarity.
     Which  brings  us\,  neatly\,  t
 o  Therapy?͛s  fifteenth  studio 
  album\,  Cleave.  Roughly  themed 
  around  notions  of  duality  and
   division\,  the  band͛s  follow-
 up  to  2015͛s  acclaimed  Disqui
 et  -  and  their  first  recordin
 g  for  new  label  Marshall  Reco
 rds  –is  a  sharply  focused\,  
 fiercely  intelligent\,  impassione
 d  and  empowering  set  of  songs
   from  a  band  operating  at  a 
  creative  and  artistic  peak.  A
   scathing\,  incisive  state-of-th
 e-nation  address\,  investigating 
  the  schisms  in  contemporary  s
 ociety  and  the  motivations  of 
  those  seeking  to  propagate  di
 sjuncture\,  it͛s  a  powerful\,  c
 hallenging\,  uncompromising  colle
 ction  from  a  band  never  afrai
 d  to  confront  and  dissect  hum
 anity͛s  darkest  impulses.  \n\nFr
 om  the  thrillingly  propulsive  
 assault  of  Wreck  It  Like  Beck
 ett  via  the  addictive  Callow  
 (the  album's  first  single\,  out
   now)  and  the  unsettling  I  S
 tand  Alone  to  the  disquieting\,
   bleakly  beautiful  No  Sunshine
 \,  the  ten  tracks  which  make  
 up  Cleave  coalesce  to  paint  a
   portrait  of  a  fractured\,  dis
 located  world  rent  by  unprinci
 pled\,  mendacious  masters.  ͞We͛
 re  living  in  a  time  riven  by
   conflict\,͟  Andy  Cairns  state
 s  baldly.  ͞You  look  at  what͛
 s  happening  in  the  United  Sta

  on  with  Brexit  in  the  UK\,  w
 ith  North  and  South  Korea\,  wi
 th  Palestine  and  Israel\,  and  
 it͛s  impossible  not  to  see  t
 urmoil  and  turbulence.  Some  of
   these  conflicts  have  been  go

   this  point.  Their  story  begi

   We  never  want  to  be  a  temp
 late  band\,  writing  the  same  s

   Sheldon\,  who  worked  with  the
   band  on  Troublegum\,  1998͛s  
 Semi-Detached  and  2003͛s  High 
  Anxiety\,  for  keeping  the  band

 . €22.50/20\nOn sale Wednesday at
  10am\n\nHayseed Dixie began one day
  in 2000 when John Wheeler and Mik
 e Daly drank roughly enough whiske
 y to float a battleship from the F
 lorida Coast over to Portugal and 
 back and\ndecided to play around in
  John’s studio. Having spent the
  previous few years touring around
  with assorted country hat-acts\, J
 ohn had assembled a proper pile of
  recording equipment. \n\nThus when 
 he and Mike discovered in their dr
 unken epiphany that the Lost Highw
 ay of Reverend Hank Williams and t
 he Highway to Hell of Bishop Bon S
 cott were indeed the same identica
 l stretch of tarmac\, they were wel
 l and truly prepared to document t
 his revelation in situ. \n\nNow\, 17 
 years and 14 albums later\, with gl
 obal physical sales in excess of h
 alf a million and over 1\,200 live 
 shows in 31 different countries un
 der their belts\, Hayseed Dixie are
  the undisputed\ncreators of the mu
 sical genre\, Rockgrass. There are 
 many copycats\, converts\, and disci
 ples out there. Accept no imitatio

 lxe2NzI \n\nEver since forming 16 ye
 ars ago\, Irish trio God Is An Astr
 onaut has reigned as one of the pr
 emier instrumental groups. With it
 s fusion of intense rock instrumen
 tation\, ethereal and emotional sou
 ndscapes\, awe-inspiring dynamics a
 nd transfixing melodies. \n\nEach of
  their prior releases has offered 
 a breath taking sonic journey\, and
  their ninth emotive opus\, Epitaph
 \, is a record that both sees a pro
 gression in their sound while stil
 l remaining true to their ethos th
 at helped define the band. The cov
 er artwork was painted by French a
 rtist Fursy Teyssier and fits the 
 melancholic mood beautifully. Join
 ed by long-time drummer Lloyd Hann
 ey\, contributions also come from X
 enon Field on sound design and for
 mer member Jamie Dean on keys. \n\nT
 he opening title track ‘Epitaph’
  sets the album`s mood. There is p
 ain and loss at work here\, but not
  pain and loss that are given in t
 o. Sparse piano motifs face energe
 tic rhythms\, shimmering guitar coa
 tings\, and eruptions of dense fury
  breathe life into a journey of me
 lancholic longing: there is the re
 lease experienced when a troubled 
 existence ends in ‘Mortal Coil‘
  followed by the sombre foreshadow
 ing that is ‘Winter Dusk/Awakeni
 ng‘. \n\nThe album changes directi
 on slightly with ‘Seánce Room’
  and the music on this highway is 
 taking you someplace meaningful an
 d special – someplace where near
  and far blur and stars weep over 
 tragedies. \n\n‘Komorebi’ is a w
 ord from Japanese. Think of the in
 terplay between light and leaves w
 hen sunlight shines through trees.
 The song has a melancholic longing
  or nostalgia for a person\, place 
 or thing that is far away from you
  or about to slip away. \n\n‘Medea
 ’ references Greek mythology\, an
 d the enchantress who married Jaso
 n\, leader of the Argonauts\, only t
 o be later guilty of filicide\, a c
 rime so against the natural order 
 of things that you can imagine the
  stars in the sky weeping. It is n
 ot easy to confront such things\, b
 ut this record and this band don’
 t shirk the challenge. \n\nFinally\, 
 the beautiful and hypnotic piece o
 f music that is the album-closing 
 ‘Oisín’ is in memory of Torst
 en and Niels' 7-year-old cousin wh
 o was tragically taken from this w
 orld. It distills into four minute
 s all the pain\, sadness and longin
 g felt by many over a much-longer 
 timeframe. A fitting end to an alb
 um that will move you deeply and c
 all out to you to be revisited man
 y times. \n\n\n© NAPALM RECORDS \nrel

  Hall of Fame inductee and Grammy®
 - winning singer and songwriter OZ
 ZY OSBOURNE today revealed details
  about his forthcoming "NO MORE TO
 URS 2\," a reference to his 1992 "N
 o More Tours" trek. The tour will 
 open at Dublin’s 3Arena on 30th 
 January 2019 with special guests J
 udas Priest.\n\nThe announcement by 
 the legendary musical icon about t
 he European dates extends the Nort
 h American tour\, announced earlier
  this year\, with his long time col
 laborators Zakk Wylde (Guitar)\, Bl
 asko (Bass)\, Tommy Clufetos (Drums
 ) and Adam Wakeman (Keyboards).\n\nT
 his summer saw OZZY go solo on the
  European festival circuit\, with h
 eadline performances at Download U

 more than five decades as a perfor
 mer (both as a solo artist and as

 xpected to take OZZY around the wo

 ***\n\nOne of the most international
 ly respected and influential heavy
  rock bands of their generation or
  any other\, Mastodon continue to p
 ush forward musically\, lyrically\, 
 compositionally and have become a 
 genre unto themselves as a result.
  Their current acclaimed album\, Em
 peror Of Sand\, has won a 2018 GRAM
 MY® Award for “Best Metal Perfo
 rmance” for the track “Sultan’
 s Curse”. The Atlanta rock band 
 was also nominated in the “Best 
 Rock Album” category for Emperor
  of Sand. This marks Mastodon’s 
 first Grammy win following their p
 revious five GRAMMY® nominations 
 to date. The album also landed the
  #1 spot in METAL HAMMER Top 100 A
 lbums Of The Year\, and Mastodon pi
 cked up ‘Best Live Band’ at th
 e 2017 Metal Hammer Golden Gods. E
 mperor of Sand remains both a crit
 ical and commercial success for th
 e quartet. Not only did it become 
 the group’s third release to bow
  in the Top 10 of the Billboard To
 p 200\, but it also debuted at #1 o
 n the Billboard Rock chart as well
  as #1 on the Physical album chart
 . Emperor of Sand was released to 
 widespread praise:\n\n“That Mastod
 on are capable of channeling perso
 nal tragedies into madcap sci-fi f
 antasy is impressive\, but on Emper
 or Of Sand they finally harness th
 eir musical ambitions as well.” 
 – Pitchfork\n\n“Their most ambit
 ious album in years - Mastodon is 
 one of the most beloved heavy band
 s on earth.” - Rolling Stone Mag
 azine\n\n“Mastodon has an innate a
 bility to be both accessible and r
 eally friggin' far out at the same
  time.” -  Revolver Magazine\n\n“
 The music of Emperor Of Sand is an
  emotional statement in itself. Fu
 ry and invention coexist\, and rage
 \, while palpable\, isn’t the sole
  or dominant characteristic… met
 al that soars with authority and i
 ntellect. Emperor Of Sand stands a
 s another arresting work by Mastod
 on\, which may very well be contemp
 orary metal’s most compelling gr

 ***\n\nOne of the most international
 ly respected and influential heavy
  rock bands of their generation or
  any other\, Mastodon continue to p
 ush forward musically\, lyrically\, 
 compositionally and have become a 
 genre unto themselves as a result.
  Their current acclaimed album\, Em
 peror Of Sand\, has won a 2018 GRAM
 MY® Award for “Best Metal Perfo
 rmance” for the track “Sultan’
 s Curse”. The Atlanta rock band 
 was also nominated in the “Best 
 Rock Album” category for Emperor
  of Sand. This marks Mastodon’s 
 first Grammy win following their p
 revious five GRAMMY® nominations 
 to date. The album also landed the
  #1 spot in METAL HAMMER Top 100 A
 lbums Of The Year\, and Mastodon pi
 cked up ‘Best Live Band’ at th
 e 2017 Metal Hammer Golden Gods. E
 mperor of Sand remains both a crit
 ical and commercial success for th
 e quartet. Not only did it become 
 the group’s third release to bow
  in the Top 10 of the Billboard To
 p 200\, but it also debuted at #1 o
 n the Billboard Rock chart as well
  as #1 on the Physical album chart
 . Emperor of Sand was released to 
 widespread praise:\n\n“That Mastod
 on are capable of channeling perso
 nal tragedies into madcap sci-fi f
 antasy is impressive\, but on Emper
 or Of Sand they finally harness th
 eir musical ambitions as well.” 
 – Pitchfork\n\n“Their most ambit
 ious album in years - Mastodon is 
 one of the most beloved heavy band
 s on earth.” - Rolling Stone Mag
 azine\n\n“Mastodon has an innate a
 bility to be both accessible and r
 eally friggin' far out at the same
  time.” -  Revolver Magazine\n\n“
 The music of Emperor Of Sand is an
  emotional statement in itself. Fu
 ry and invention coexist\, and rage
 \, while palpable\, isn’t the sole
  or dominant characteristic… met
 al that soars with authority and i
 ntellect. Emperor Of Sand stands a
 s another arresting work by Mastod
 on\, which may very well be contemp
 orary metal’s most compelling gr
 oup.” - Wall Street Journal\n\nChe

SUMMARY:Paranoid Beast Presents Bell Witch plus Support
LOCATION:The Thomas House
URL:https://www.facebook.com/events/358239778050509/
DESCRIPTION:Seattle doom metal duo\, BELL WITCH
 \, have confirmed a full European t
 our in support of their recently r
 eleased opus\, Mirror Reaper. \n\nRel
 eased by Profound Lore in October\,
  Mirror Reaper was engineered and 
 mixed by veteran producer Billy An
 derson (Swans\, Sleep\, Neurosis)\, t
 he duo of Dylan Desmond (bass\, voc
 als) and Jesse Shreibman (drums\, v
 ocals\, organ) have pushed the band
 ’s sound further beyond their la
 ndmark 2015 LP\, Four Phantoms offe
 ring up one continuous\, eighty-thr
 ee-minute piece unfolding as a sin
 gle track. While retaining the col
 ossal heaviness of their previous 
 releases\, Mirror Reaper sees the b
 and explore the more meditative\, m
 elancholy\, and introspective aspec
 ts to their sound through the intr
 oduction of long\, lonely organ pas
 sages and the return of vocalist E
 rik Moggridge (Aerial Ruin)\, offer
 ing a prominent presence.\n\nAlongsi
 de director\, Taylor Bednarz\, BELL 
 WITCH has created a feature-length
  music video to accompany the albu
 m. The film is a video collage com
 prised of dozens of archival films
 . Each of these clips are woven to
 gether with the album to build a p
 atient\, heavy\, and haunting narrat
 ive. The film aims to hold the vie
 wer in the state of a lucid dream\,
  feeling trapped as a specter drif
 ting through places of darkness. M
 irror Reaper will be a projection 
 for the band’s live performances
 \, as well as a standalone cinemati
 c experience. The trailer for the

 \n=======================\n\nRATO RAR
 O is a band from Palencia founded 
 in 1992 by the brothers Toño and 
 Raúl who have maintained the band
  during all these years\, in 2008 V
 isy joined them on guitar and they
  have remained as this trio since.
 \nThe lyrics of the band deal with 
 drug abuse\, mental self-destructio
 n\, alcohol and excesses but they a
 lso have their demands against abu
 ses of power\, wars and injustices.
  To date they have released three 
 albums\, the most recent " Molecule
 ccosedelia " in 2014.\nThe style th
 ey practice is a kind of fusion be
 tween Grindcore and Punk-Crust inf
 luenced by bands like Repulsion\, T
 he Exploited\, Doom\, Napalm Death o
 r Terrorizer.\n\nhttps://www.faceboo

 \n\nAbaddon Incarnate can be charact
 erized as being heavily influenced
  by both Grindcore and Death Metal
  as well as many other kinds of ge
 nres such as Sludge\, Crust\, Punk a
 nd Doom.\nOriginally formed as Deat
 h/Thrash band BEREAVED back in 198
 9\, this early incarnation recorded
  two demos. ‘Signs Of Death’ i
 n a1992 and ‘Tortured Souls’ i
 n 1994. The decision was then made
  in 1994 to change to a faster and
  more brutal Death/Grindcore style
 \, so they changed their name to AB
 ADDON INCARNATE and since then the
  band has released a demo cassette
 \, two promos\, five full-length alb
 ums\, a Split 7" with US grind band
  PHOPIA and most recently a live a
 lbum.\nThe band has played alongsid
 e notable bands such as OBITUARY\, 
 NAPALM DEATH and BOLT THROWER also
  performing at the London Death Fe
 st\, Day of Darkness\, Dublin Death 
 Fest and the Siege Of Limerick. Th
 ey have toured extensively in Euro
 pe including Spain\, France\, Britai
 n\, Switzerland\, Germany. They have
  also toured as far away as Russia
 \, Australia\, and were the first ex
 treme Irish metal band to play in 
 Ecuador\, Colombia and Peru.\n\nhttp:

 ======\n\nBisect is a band that form
 ed during 2013 from the ashes of a
  Polish band that carried the same
  name. Based in Cork\, the band cur
 rently is comprised of an internat
 ional team of Irish\, Polish and It
 alian musicians. Phil Langero (LOS
  LANGEROS) on the vocals\, Kieran O
 ’Neill on the drums\, Maciek Lach
 mann on the bass and Fabrizio Vita
 li on guitar and backing vocals.\nB
 isect sound doesn't really fit any
  one label\, maybe a result of thei
 r Polish/Italian/Irish background\,
  but the resulting musical blend i
 s an aggressive hardcore d-beat so
 und with brutality and grind front
 ed by two intense vocalists with c
 rushing lyrics that scream about i
 ssues like social justice\, inclusi
 on/marginalisation\,poverty\, etc\nTh
 eir pummelling albums “We Are Th
 e Migrants” (2013) and "Time The
  Bastards Fell" (2018)\, as well as
  the Split 12" with Cork band HORS
 E\, are availble via bandcamp.\n\nhtt

SUMMARY:Paranoid Beast Promotions presents Bell Witch + Support
LOCATION:Cyprus Avenue
URL:https://www.facebook.com/events/293215161487436/
DESCRIPTION:Seattle doom metal duo\, BELL WITCH
 \, have confirmed a full European t
 our in support of their recently r
 eleased opus\, Mirror Reaper. \n\nRel
 eased by Profound Lore in October\,
  Mirror Reaper was engineered and 
 mixed by veteran producer Billy An
 derson (Swans\, Sleep\, Neurosis)\, t
 he duo of Dylan Desmond (bass\, voc
 als) and Jesse Shreibman (drums\, v
 ocals\, organ) have pushed the band
 ’s sound further beyond their la
 ndmark 2015 LP\, Four Phantoms offe
 ring up one continuous\, eighty-thr
 ee-minute piece unfolding as a sin
 gle track. While retaining the col
 ossal heaviness of their previous 
 releases\, Mirror Reaper sees the b
 and explore the more meditative\, m
 elancholy\, and introspective aspec
 ts to their sound through the intr
 oduction of long\, lonely organ pas
 sages and the return of vocalist E
 rik Moggridge (Aerial Ruin)\, offer
 ing a prominent presence.\n\nAlongsi
 de director\, Taylor Bednarz\, BELL 
 WITCH has created a feature-length
  music video to accompany the albu
 m. The film is a video collage com
 prised of dozens of archival films
 . Each of these clips are woven to
 gether with the album to build a p
 atient\, heavy\, and haunting narrat
 ive. The film aims to hold the vie
 wer in the state of a lucid dream\,
  feeling trapped as a specter drif
 ting through places of darkness. M
 irror Reaper will be a projection 
 for the band’s live performances
 \, as well as a standalone cinemati
 c experience. The trailer for the 
 film is available to view HERE:\nht
