Vicar Street,Ticketmaster Events,Dropkick Murphys - Vicar Street Dublin,2019-04-18,19:00:00,2019-04-18,DROPKICK MURPHYS Vicar St Dublin 17 & 18 April 2019  Celtic punk-rock legends Dropkick Murphys will return to Dublin for two nights at Vicar St on 17 & 18 April 2019.  As much as Dropkick Murphys love Boston they were determined to start their third decade with a bang. They wanted to take it to the next level. For that they knew they'd need to make a record that blew people away. To do that they'd need to focus. To do that they'd need to remove all distractions. To do that they'd need to go to...El Paso?  You heard that right! They packed up their gear and hit the road joining longtime producer Ted Hutt at a studio 30 miles east of El Paso. Sonic Ranch Studios whose property abuts the U.S./Mexico border is a place where the only cell service is the occasional bar that pops up from a Mexican carrier. This bold move this dedication this desolation – and this amazing studio – helped the band capture something magical on their new album 11 Short Stories Of Pain & Glory.  A look back at childhood life a snapshot of a clueless Masshole a stop-you-in-your tracks reflection on a terrorist tragedy...it’s all there across the record’s 11 tracks. There are moments of ass-kicking Celtic punk attitude ball-busting wisecracks tear-jerking confessions and the kind of upbeat words of wisdom that can be chanted loud and proud across arenas and stadiums worldwide. It’s real. It’s raw. It’s Dropkick Murphys.  11 Short Stories Of Pain & Glory represents a high-water mark for Dropkick Murphys as they invite listeners everywhere to once again take an active part in their story. “We’ve stayed true to what the band is and has always been. And we’re still expanding on our sound and lyrical content” offers Brennan.  “There is lots of messed up stuff going on in the world but you can't let it take you down” Casey continues. “The only way to survive in life is to enjoy it and make the most of it. That’s what this record is. There’s good times. There’s bad times. There’s happy times. There’s sad times. In just 40 minutes you feel all of that. We truly put our heart and soul into every record we’ve ever made. This is no exception. We wouldn’t let it go down any other way. We’ll break up before that happens.” 11 Short Stories Of Pain & Glory is the perfect way to kick off another 20 years of Dropkick Murphys. Hold your head high and crank it up.  Dropkick Murphys are:  Al Barr lead vocals  Tim Brennan guitars accordion mellotron whistles and vocals  Ken Casey lead vocals and bass guitar  Jeff DaRosa banjo bouzouki mandolin harmonica acoustic guitars and vocals  Matt Kelly drums percussion and vocals  James Lynch guitars and vocals  www.dropkickmurphys.com/  Tickets priced €32.50 go on sale Monday 8th October at 10am through www.ticketmaster.ie & usual outlets nationwide.  www.dropkickmurphys.com/  https://www.facebook.com/events/607749826320230/,Europe/Dublin

Tickets go on public sale this Friday Nov 9th at 9AM local time with tickets available at www.idlesband.com.  IDLES’ new record 'Joy As An Act Of Resistance' debuted at no.5 in the UK charts breaking Rough Trade’s all-time record for most pre-orders and sales in day. It is currently the no.1 best reviewed record of 2018 (average rating of 88 across 25 reviews) at Album Of The Year and in the Top 10 on Metacritic.   The band saw not only singles but the album itself A-listed at 6 Music and earned major features amongst others with the likes of Q Mojo The Guardian and covers with DIY Loud & Quiet So Young and NME. They’ve arrived internationally too with only last week NPR Music declaring “I am an IDLES addict. It's like mainlining an uplifting and unifying assault on nationalism racism intolerance and class inequality.”   The band won Best Breakthrough at the Q Awards last month following their Jools Holland debut which NME called “history in the making…incomparably brilliant” likening it to Arctic Monkeys and Kanye West's first appearances on the show.

An instant classic one that people will turn to in times of need for years to come.” 10/10 NME  “This album is a heart-breaking but jubilant exploration of joy honesty fragility and expression as our most powerful means of human resistance.”  9/10 Classic Rock  “IDLES have released the most relevant and at times gut wrenching album of the year.” Drowned In Sound  “IDLES make sense of modern chaos on the utterly essential Joy as an Act of Resistance.” The Line Of Best Fit  “Idles take their rightful place as not Britain’s nor Europe’s but the world’s most vital band. It’s a fist-clenched celebration of the full spectrum of phenomena - inexplicable crushing and totally joyous - that divides and unites us all.” The Quietus  “IDLES deliver a thunderous and sharp state-of-the-nation address.” The 405  http://www.idlesband.com/  https://www.facebook.com/idlesband/  https://twitter.com/idlesband  https://www.instagram.com/idlesband/  https://www.facebook.com/events/687920031608626/,Europe/Dublin

Cyprus Avenue,Eventbrite,Therapy?,2019-03-23,19:30:00,2019-03-23,Andy Cairns tells a great story about Therapy?’s spring UK tour with The Stranglers. As the trio walked onstage in Kilmarnock Scotland their frontman noticed a solitary punter three rows from the front vigorously booing his band before a single amplified guitar chord had been struck. Each successive song in the set received the same vociferous relentlessly hostile response. Two nights later at Nottingham Rock City the antagonist was back once more front and centre still booing though with markedly less enmity than before. In Manchester on the final night of the campaign Cairns stepped from his tour bus to be confronted again by the by-now-familiar face of his new nemesis. This time however the guy was clutching a pen and a copy of Therapy?’s classic 1994 album Troublegum. “Could you sign this for me please?” he asked politely.  “I think we’d battered him into submission” Cairns says with a laugh.  It’s an instructive anecdote both a testament to Therapy?’s enduring capacity to win over hearts and minds with their singular sui generis sound and a reminder in a broader sense that even in the face of alienation disaffection and discord there remains hope for consensus harmony and solidarity.   Which brings us neatly to Therapy?’s fifteenth studio album Cleave. Roughly themed around notions of duality and division the band’s follow-up to 2015’s acclaimed Disquiet - and their first recording for new label Marshall Records – is a sharply focused fiercely intelligent impassioned and empowering set of songs from a band operating at a creative and artistic peak. A scathing incisive state-of-the-nation address investigating the schisms in contemporary society and the motivations of those seeking to propagate disjuncture it’s a powerful challenging uncompromising collection from a band never afraid to confront and dissect humanity’s darkest impulses.  https://www.facebook.com/events/460206744507522/,Europe/Dublin

From the thrillingly propulsive assault of Wreck It Like Beckett via the addictive Callow (the album's first single out now) and the unsettling I Stand Alone to the disquieting bleakly beautiful No Sunshine the ten tracks which make up Cleave coalesce to paint a portrait of a fractured dislocated world rent by unprincipled mendacious masters. “We’re living in a time riven by conflict” Andy Cairns states baldly. “You look at what’s happening in the United States at present what’s going on with Brexit in the UK with North and South Korea with Palestine and Israel and it’s impossible not to see turmoil and turbulence. Some of these conflicts have been going on as long as I can remember but they seemed to really reach a head again around the time we were writing the album. Cleave is our response to the divisions we see all around us.”  It’s worth considering Therapy?’s journey to this point. Their story begins in Northern Ireland in 1989 when vocalist/guitarist Cairns bassist Michael McKeegan and drummer Fyfe Ewing – bonded by a deep appreciation of post-punk art-rock Detroit techno and the most uncompromising sounds from the fringes of the US noise rock underground – embarked upon a mission to investigate the psyches of the marginalised malcontent and misanthropic. The 1990 release of a self-financed seven inch single (Meat Abstract) on the band’s own Multifuckingnational Records label was followed by the recording of a brace of bold abrasive mini albums 1991's Babyteeth and 1992's Pleasure Death for London-based Wiiija record both collections securing Number 1 slots on the UK’s Independent music charts. Such success did not go unnoticed by the nation’s major labels and the in-demand trio elected to partner next with A&M Records for whom they promptly delivered a Top 30 single (Teethgrinder) and Top 40 album (Nurse) in 1993. On a creative roll in 1994 Therapy? truly hit their stride with the electrifying exhilarating punk-metal crossover set Troublegum which served up no fewer than five UK Top 40 singles (Turn Nowhere Die Laughing Trigger Inside and Screamager the opening track from 1993 EP Shortsharpshock) sold one million copies worldwide and garnered the fast-rising band a Mercury Music Prize nomination. Unwilling to dilute their vision in pursuit of mainstream acceptance the band spent much of the two decades which followed re-writing the rule book for what constitutes success for a modern rock act issuing a succession of fiercely idiosyncratic albums aided and abetted by the recruitment in 2002 of drummer Neil Cooper. To the delight of their loyal fan-base in 2015 the trio conceived a sequel of sorts to Troublegum in Disquiet a brilliantly-realised bruisingly melodic punk/metal collection which took as its starting point questions of where the adolescent protagonist of their 1994 masterpiece might find himself 20 years on. Stepping away from that fascinating narrative Cleave continues along a similar sonic path alluding to the band’s ‘classic’ sound while opening up new paths to explore.  “The way I’ve described Cleave to people who’ve been asking is that it’s kinda like Nurse and Pleasure Death-era Therapy? meets Troublegum but with a totally modern 21st century production” says Cairns of the 10 song collection committed to tape by producer Chris Sheldon at Blast studios in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in January this year. “I think we’ve become a lot more comfortable about doing what we do best. Around the time of [2009’s] Crooked Timber and [2010’s] A Brief Crack Of Light I was still trying to prove a point to people that I listen to a lot of different music and trying to illustrate that in the music we were writing. But when we did Disquiet and saw the reaction we got from people who love guitar music and love our band it made me realise that there’s certain things we do so well certain things that are so characteristic of Therapy? so we decided to focus on these things. We never want to be a template band writing the same song forever but we did definitely try to play to our strengths.”  Cairns credits producer Sheldon who worked with the band on Troublegum 1998’s Semi-Detached and 2003’s High Anxiety for keeping the band fixated upon delivering their new material with maximum impact streamlining arrangements and stripping away extraneous fat setting aside ego in service of the songs. “We know we can trust Chris” says Cairns simply. “He has a great history with the band and no agenda. It’s not like he’s looking to make hit singles but he also wants the band to be at their maximum ability and he’s very good at pointing out problems without offending you! In pre-production we shortened a lot of the songs and got directly to the point. You can get into your own little bubble when you’re writing songs so it’s great to have someone objective come in and challenge you to re-think things.” The result is one of the most formidable provocative and impactful albums of Therapy?’s storied 29 year career once again proving that the band’s pre-eminence as one of the UK’s most inventive fearless and individualistic musical artists. Andy Cairns offers a detailed dissection of the album in the track-by-track breakdown that follows but taking a broader view of his band’s fifteenth studio set he’s justifiably proud of the unified drive and restless creativity evident in this powerful questing collection. “I know that we can be a difficult sell because we have no particular niche and no desire to conform” he admits “but Therapy? have always the kind of band that when people discover us they immerse themselves deep and keep us close to their hearts. We’ve never been part of a trend so we’ve never been cast aside when fashions changed. Cleave to me is Therapy? at our most focused. I love our more experimental side but I also love that this record sounds like it was made by a band who’re all reading from the same script and moving forward with the same determination and hunger.”  https://www.facebook.com/events/359050538197140/,Europe/Dublin

Róisín Dubh,Strange Brew,Therapy?,2019-03-21,20:00:00,2019-03-21,Strange Brew presents THERAPY? In association with Aiken Promotions  Thursday 21st March  8pm. €24/22 On sale Thursday at 9am  Andy  Cairns  tells  a  great  story  about  Therapy?͛s  spring  UK  tour  with  The  Stranglers.  As  the  trio  walked  onstage  in  Kilmarnock  Scotland  their  frontman  noticed  a  solitary  punter  three  rows  from  the  front  vigorously  booing  his  band  before  a  single  amplified  guitar  chord  had  been  struck.  Each  successive  song  in  the  set  received  the  same  vociferous  relentlessly  hostile  response.  Two  nights  later  at  Nottingham  Rock  City  the  antagonist  was  back  once  more  front  and  centre  still  booing  though  with  markedly  less  enmity  than  before.  In  Manchester  on  the  final  night  of  the  campaign  Cairns  stepped  from  his  tour  bus  to  be  confronted  again  by  the  by-now-familiar  face  of  his  new  nemesis.  This  time  however  the  guy  was  clutching  a  pen  and  a  copy  of  Therapy?͛s  classic  1994  album  Troublegum.  ͞Could  you  sign  this  for  me  please?͟  he  asked  politely.  ͞I  think  we͛d  battered  him  into  submission͟  Cairns  says  with  a  laugh.  It͛s  an  instructive  anecdote  both  a  testament  to  Therapy?͛s  enduring  capacity  to  win  over  hearts  and  minds  with  their  singular  sui  generis  sound  and  a  reminder  in  a  broader  sense  that  even  in  the  face  of  alienation  disaffection  and  discord  there  remains  hope  for  consensus  harmony  and  solidarity.    Which  brings  us  neatly  to  Therapy?͛s  fifteenth  studio  album  Cleave.  Roughly  themed  around  notions  of  duality  and  division  the  band͛s  follow-up  to  2015͛s  acclaimed  Disquiet  -  and  their  first  recording  for  new  label  Marshall  Records  –is  a  sharply  focused  fiercely  intelligent  impassioned  and  empowering  set  of  songs  from  a  band  operating  at  a  creative  and  artistic  peak.

Epitaph 2. Mortal Coil 3. Winter Dusk/Awakening 4. Seance Room 5. Komorebi 6. Medea 7. Oisín   smarturl.it/Epitaph-NPR (VINYL CD T-SHIRT PRE-ORDER)   youtu.be/6j7Blxe2NzI   Ever since forming 16 years ago Irish trio God Is An Astronaut has reigned as one of the premier instrumental groups. With its fusion of intense rock instrumentation ethereal and emotional soundscapes awe-inspiring dynamics and transfixing melodies.   Each of their prior releases has offered a breath taking sonic journey and their ninth emotive opus Epitaph is a record that both sees a progression in their sound while still remaining true to their ethos that helped define the band. The cover artwork was painted by French artist Fursy Teyssier and fits the melancholic mood beautifully. Joined by long-time drummer Lloyd Hanney contributions also come from Xenon Field on sound design and former member Jamie Dean on keys.   The opening title track ‘Epitaph’ sets the album`s mood. There is pain and loss at work here but not pain and loss that are given in to. Sparse piano motifs face energetic rhythms shimmering guitar coatings and eruptions of dense fury breathe life into a journey of melancholic longing: there is the release experienced when a troubled existence ends in ‘Mortal Coil‘ followed by the sombre foreshadowing that is ‘Winter Dusk/Awakening‘.   The album changes direction slightly with ‘Seánce Room’ and the music on this highway is taking you someplace meaningful and special – someplace where near and far blur and stars weep over tragedies.   ‘Komorebi’ is a word from Japanese. Think of the interplay between light and leaves when sunlight shines through trees.The song has a melancholic longing or nostalgia for a person place or thing that is far away from you or about to slip away.   ‘Medea’ references Greek mythology and the enchantress who married Jason leader of the Argonauts only to be later guilty of filicide a crime so against the natural order of things that you can imagine the stars in the sky weeping. It is not easy to confront such things but this record and this band don’t shirk the challenge.   Finally the beautiful and hypnotic piece of music that is the album-closing ‘Oisín’ is in memory of Torsten and Niels' 7-year-old cousin who was tragically taken from this world. It distills into four minutes all the pain sadness and longing felt by many over a much-longer timeframe. A fitting end to an album that will move you deeply and call out to you to be revisited many times.    © NAPALM RECORDS  releases April 27 2018   Written and performed by God Is An Astronaut.

Their current acclaimed album Emperor Of Sand has won a 2018 GRAMMY® Award for “Best Metal Performance” for the track “Sultan’s Curse”. The Atlanta rock band was also nominated in the “Best Rock Album” category for Emperor of Sand. This marks Mastodon’s first Grammy win following their previous five GRAMMY® nominations to date. The album also landed the #1 spot in METAL HAMMER Top 100 Albums Of The Year and Mastodon picked up ‘Best Live Band’ at the 2017 Metal Hammer Golden Gods. Emperor of Sand remains both a critical and commercial success for the quartet. Not only did it become the group’s third release to bow in the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 200 but it also debuted at #1 on the Billboard Rock chart as well as #1 on the Physical album chart. Emperor of Sand was released to widespread praise:  “That Mastodon are capable of channeling personal tragedies into madcap sci-fi fantasy is impressive but on Emperor Of Sand they finally harness their musical ambitions as well.” – Pitchfork  “Their most ambitious album in years - Mastodon is one of the most beloved heavy bands on earth.” - Rolling Stone Magazine  “Mastodon has an innate ability to be both accessible and really friggin' far out at the same time.” -  Revolver Magazine  “The music of Emperor Of Sand is an emotional statement in itself. Fury and invention coexist and rage while palpable isn’t the sole or dominant characteristic… metal that soars with authority and intellect. Emperor Of Sand stands as another arresting work by Mastodon which may very well be contemporary metal’s most compelling group.” - Wall Street Journal  As previously announced Reprise Records have released a pair of exclusive 12” vinyl picture discs as part of our on-going “Picture This” series. Brann Dailor’s solo track “Red Death”is one of the 6 songs found on DC Comics’ Dark Nights: Metal: Deluxe Edition collection which comes with a poster and 32-page comic book and limited to 4000 copies worldwide.

It’s filled with rousing songs that are timeless in their sentiment but directly related to today’s most pressing concerns: politics the economy unemployment planned boomtowns gone bust immigration policies gone awry and much more.

The Thomas House,Paranoid Beast Promotions,Paranoid Beast Presents Bell Witch plus Support,2018-12-14,21:00:00,2018-12-15,Seattle doom metal duo BELL WITCH have confirmed a full European tour in support of their recently released opus Mirror Reaper.   Released by Profound Lore in October Mirror Reaper was engineered and mixed by veteran producer Billy Anderson (Swans Sleep Neurosis) the duo of Dylan Desmond (bass vocals) and Jesse Shreibman (drums vocals organ) have pushed the band’s sound further beyond their landmark 2015 LP Four Phantoms offering up one continuous eighty-three-minute piece unfolding as a single track. While retaining the colossal heaviness of their previous releases Mirror Reaper sees the band explore the more meditative melancholy and introspective aspects to their sound through the introduction of long lonely organ passages and the return of vocalist Erik Moggridge (Aerial Ruin) offering a prominent presence.  Alongside director Taylor Bednarz BELL WITCH has created a feature-length music video to accompany the album. The film is a video collage comprised of dozens of archival films. Each of these clips are woven together with the album to build a patient heavy and haunting narrative. The film aims to hold the viewer in the state of a lucid dream feeling trapped as a specter drifting through places of darkness. Mirror Reaper will be a projection for the band’s live performances as well as a standalone cinematic experience. The trailer for the film is available to view HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZAtlAQMGzI&feature=youtu.be  https://www.facebook.com/events/358239778050509/,Europe/Dublin
Fred Zeppelins,Irish Metal Archive,Rato Raro / Abaddon Incarnate / Bisect - Fredz Cork (14/12/18),2018-12-14,20:45:00,2018-12-15,HAPPY FUCKING XMAS!!! The Irish Metal Archive presents...  RATO RARO (Spain - Grindcore) Abaddon Incarnate (Dublin - Grindcore/Death Metal) Bisect (Cork - Grind/Hardcore)  Fred Zeppelins Parliament St. Cork. Friday 14th December 2018  Start Time: 8:45pm Door Tax: €7  =======================  RATO RARO is a band from Palencia founded in 1992 by the brothers Toño and Raúl who have maintained the band during all these years in 2008 Visy joined them on guitar and they have remained as this trio since. The lyrics of the band deal with drug abuse mental self-destruction alcohol and excesses but they also have their demands against abuses of power wars and injustices. To date they have released three albums the most recent " Moleculeccosedelia " in 2014. The style they practice is a kind of fusion between Grindcore and Punk-Crust influenced by bands like Repulsion The Exploited Doom Napalm Death or Terrorizer.  https://www.facebook.com/RATO-RARO-276042829080131/   https://ratoraro.bandcamp.com/   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux12PgU4ogE  =======================  Abaddon Incarnate can be characterized as being heavily influenced by both Grindcore and Death Metal as well as many other kinds of genres such as Sludge Crust Punk and Doom. Originally formed as Death/Thrash band BEREAVED back in 1989 this early incarnation recorded two demos. ‘Signs Of Death’ in a1992 and ‘Tortured Souls’ in 1994. The decision was then made in 1994 to change to a faster and more brutal Death/Grindcore style so they changed their name to ABADDON INCARNATE and since then the band has released a demo cassette two promos five full-length albums a Split 7" with US grind band PHOPIA and most recently a live album. The band has played alongside notable bands such as OBITUARY NAPALM DEATH and BOLT THROWER also performing at the London Death Fest Day of Darkness Dublin Death Fest and the Siege Of Limerick. They have toured extensively in Europe including Spain France Britain Switzerland Germany. They have also toured as far away as Russia Australia and were the first extreme Irish metal band to play in Ecuador Colombia and Peru.  http://www.irishmetalarchive.com/artists/abaddon-incarnate/  https://www.facebook.com/abaddonincarnate  https://abaddonincarnate.bigcartel.com/  https://soundcloud.com/stevef-1/sets/abaddon   =======================  Bisect is a band that formed during 2013 from the ashes of a Polish band that carried the same name. Based in Cork the band currently is comprised of an international team of Irish Polish and Italian musicians. Phil Langero (LOS LANGEROS) on the vocals Kieran O’Neill on the drums Maciek Lachmann on the bass and Fabrizio Vitali on guitar and backing vocals. Bisect sound doesn't really fit any one label maybe a result of their Polish/Italian/Irish background but the resulting musical blend is an aggressive hardcore d-beat sound with brutality and grind fronted by two intense vocalists with crushing lyrics that scream about issues like social justice inclusion/marginalisationpoverty etc Their pummelling albums “We Are The Migrants” (2013) and "Time The Bastards Fell" (2018) as well as the Split 12" with Cork band HORSE are availble via bandcamp.  http://www.irishmetalarchive.com/artists/bisect/  https://bisect.bandcamp.com/  https://www.facebook.com/Bisect-477826922271974/  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWdG8nQw9ajk4w4BR-Srrmw/   =======================  https://www.facebook.com/events/232805460748222/,Europe/Dublin
